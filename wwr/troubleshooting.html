    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purposes</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to communicate with its visitors the fun that they can have by using Raging River Rafting's services to go white water rafting. It is to convey to the visitors that they can create lasting memories, and those memories can be associated with Raging River Rapids, and promote repeat package purchases. </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience mostly includes lovers of the outdoors. These people can range from ages 12-70 (possibly higher), but the typical adventurous crowd would probably fall between the ages of 16-30. These people probably also enjoy camping and hiking. Groups most likely include family units, or friend groups of similar ages. This audience is looking for a thrill. They are looking for a fun time with their friends and/or family. The main need that isn't being met is stress free fun. People have a lot of reasons to worry, and this audience may be seeking a way to alleviate some of that stress for a while, as well as connect with those that they white water raft with through teamwork. This audience will most likely access my site via mobile device, but laptop and desktop will also need to be accounted for.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- Steps 6-9-->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/palette/73fbd3-44e5e7-59d2fe-4a8fe7-5c7aff"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/palette/73fbd3-44e5e7-59d2fe-4a8fe7-5c7aff</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#4A8FE7</td>
        <td class="secondary">#59D2FE</td>
        <td class="accent1">#44E5E7</td>
