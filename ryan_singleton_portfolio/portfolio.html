                Hi,  My name is Ryan Singleton. I am a front-end developer. Besides coding, I love playing basketball, reading books, and trying new foods and restaurants with my wife, Alyssa. We have 3 beautiful children - all 3 years old and under. 
        
                I believe in always improving myself and love to learn from others.  In a team setting, each person brings something important to the group and we all have the opportunity to learn from each other. I believe in bettering myself in small ways every day and applying that to my work, and vice versa.

    I have a plethora of projects to display my work on my GitHub profile at https://github.com/ryansingleton-3. These are personal projects, assignments from school, and many from the Front-End boot camp.
