    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi,  My name is Ryan Singleton. I am a front-end developer. Besides coding, I love playing basketball, reading books, and trying new foods and restaurants with my wife, Alyssa. We have 3 beautiful children - all 3 years old and under. 
 
I believe in always improving myself and love to learn from others.  In a team setting, each person brings something important to the group and we all have the opportunity to learn from each other. I believe in bettering myself in small ways every day and applying that to my work, and vice versa.

    </p>
