This website demonstrates some of my recent work and displays some of my technical skills in a very visual and digestible way.

      <h3>Home page - About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi,  My name is Ryan Singleton. I am a front-end developer. Besides coding, I love playing basketball, reading books, and trying new foods and restaurants with my wife, Alyssa. We have 3 beautiful children - all 3 years old and under. <br>
<br>
I believe in always improving myself and love to learn from others.  In a team setting, each person brings something important to the group and we all have the opportunity to learn from each other. I believe in bettering myself in small ways every day and applying that to my work, and vice versa.
