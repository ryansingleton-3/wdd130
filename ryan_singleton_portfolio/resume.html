    I am a soon-to-be graduate of a Front End Engineering Bootcamp by Promineo Tech (July 2022). I have just under 1.5 years of experience in Front End Development, including a learning platform called Codecademy, and I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from BYU-Idaho. I am very experienced with HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript. I am also familiar with React.js, Python, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Git, GitHub, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Responsive Web Design. 
Also, I have extensive knowledge in digital marketing in general, as well as SEM (Search Engine Marketing). I have multiple certifications in the industry and have worked at a digital marketing agency for almost 2 years.
